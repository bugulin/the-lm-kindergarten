"""
Filter Aristotelian-style categorical syllogisms from a JSON dataset.

Input:
  A JSON array of objects like:
  {
      "id": "...",
      "syllogism": "...",
      "validity": true/false,
      "plausibility": true/false
  }

Output:
  A JSON file with extra fields:
    - form_flag: valid_form / invalid_form / uncertain
    - form_reason
    - parsed_clauses
    - normalized_terms
    - term_count

This script is conservative:
  - If it cannot confidently map a clause to A/E/I/O form, it returns "uncertain".
  - If it maps all three clauses but structural checks fail, it returns "invalid_form".

Usage:
  python filter_syllogism_form.py --input train_data.json --output train_data_flagged.json
